# 13. History & acknowledgements

RGB was originally envisioned in 2016 by _Giacomo Zucco_ (**BHB Network**) as a "non-blockchain based asset system" basing on earlier ideas of _Peter Todd_ about client-side-validation and single-use-seals and implemented as original MVP around 2017 by BHB Network with support from **Poseidon Group**. Since 2019, _Dr Maxim Orlovsky_, **Pandora Prime AG**, acts as the main designer and lead contributor to RGB protocol, designing and implementing it in its current form. Since 2019 RGB was restructured and re-thought from scratch by as a generic form of computing and confidential smart contracting system. This development was managed by **LNP/BP Standards Association**, created in 2019 by Maxim Orlovsky & Giacomo Zucco and funded by **iFinex Inc** and **Fulgur Ventures** (2019H2-2020H1, 2022Q4-2023), **Pandora Prime AG** (2020H2-2021), personal funds of _Dr Maxim Orlovsky_ (2020H2-2021, 2022H2), **Hojo Foundation** (2022-2023), **DIBA Inc** (2023) and anonymous community donations. A lot of input into RGB design, re-design and protocol peer-review came from a broader community, which included contributions from more than 50 people and organizations, including: _Alekos Filini, Alessandro Salvetti_, _Armando Christian Dutra, Christophe Diederichs_, _Cláudio de Castro, Chris Stewart, Emil Bayes_, _Fabrizio Armani_, _Federico Tenga, Francisco Calderon_, _Juraj Bednar, Hunter Trujillo, Max Hillebrand, Marco Amadori, Masaki Muranaka_, _Martin Habovštiak_, _Nadav Kohen, Nicola Busanello_, _Olga Ukolova, Rajar Shimaitra, Rene Pickhardt_, _Reza Bandegi, Sabina Sachtachtinskagia,_ [_Sosthene_](https://github.com/Sosthene00)_,_ _Stefano Pellegrini_, [_yojoe_](https://github.com/yojoe) _ZmnSCPxj_, _Zoe Faltiba,_ [_zkao_](https://github.com/zkao)_._ The community management since 2019 was performed by _Olga Ukolova_.

Many input into protocol design ideas and suggestions came from personal conversations of Dr Maxim Orlovsky and Giacomo Zucco with notable cryptographers, specialists on distributed systems and game theorists, including: _Adam Back, Andrew Poelstra, Christian Decker_, _Christopher Allen, Pieter Wuille, Peter Todd._

We are thankful to the early adopters of RGB protocols, who invested and continue to invest into RGB integration and independent peer reviews: Bitfinex & Tether, inbitcoin, DIBA, SuredBits, Blockchain Of Things, Atomic Loans.
